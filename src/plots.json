Veronica von Dampfer has been particularly active recently, as she managed to procure a map that leads to a hidden cache of treasure. She has been assembling her crew, including some of the other characters listed, to obtain the treasure before her rivals can. However, her reputation as a notorious criminal has made it difficult for her to secure trustworthy allies, and some members of her crew may have ulterior motives. As an airship captain, Veronica is accustomed to navigating complex political terrain and dealing with danger, but she has a personal stake in this venture that is not immediately clear to her colleagues.

Veronica von Dampfer had been on an extended airship journey traveling to many distant lands in order to procure the map to the hidden treasure. After months of careful negotiations, she was able to acquire the map from an elderly scholar who had inherited it from his grandfather. The exact location of the cache of treasure is unknown to her at this point, but she has reason to believe that it is guarded by magical creatures, traps, and possibly other rival treasure hunters.

Veronica was driven to obtain the treasure not just due to its value, but because it may hold clues to the whereabouts of her long-lost sister. Her sister had gone missing many years ago under mysterious circumstances, rumored to be involved in a secret organization that conducted dangerous experiments with magic and clockwork. These experiments eventually went awry, leading to a massive explosion that destroyed the facility and killed everyone inside, including her sister.

However, Veronica had always harbored a suspicion that her sister might have somehow survived and gone into hiding. When she heard rumors of the treasure that was supposedly connected to her sister's organization, Veronica had a feeling that this could be her chance to discover the truth.

Elijah Steamweaver, who is a friend and occasional collaborator of Veronica's, has been working on an invention that he believes will revolutionize air travel. He is constantly tinkering with the design and testing new prototypes, including a steam-powered jetpack that he uses to zip around his workshop. Elijah's love of a challenge and desire to push the boundaries of what is possible drive him to pursue this project, despite the high risk of failure.
